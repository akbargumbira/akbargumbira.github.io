I am about to release the v.1 of it, I hope, in a few weeks. After comparing some options, I decided to use <a href="http://documentup.com/">DocumentUp</a>.</p>

<p>It's so simple to set up that you can just try it right away right now! Pick one of your public Github repository and go to <a href="http://documentup.com/your-username/the-repository">http://documentup.com/your-username/the-repository</a> to see how your docs look like.</p>

<p>We can also use Github Pages for our repository and get the docs rendered at <a href="http://your-username.github.io/the-repository">http://your-username.github.io/the-repository</a>. To get this working, you need to create <code>gh-pages</code> branch in your repository first and create <code>index.html</code> (<a href="https://github.com/akbargumbira/django-user-map/blob/gh-pages/index.html">See here</a>) and <code>documentup.min.js</code> (<a href="https://github.com/akbargumbira/django-user-map/blob/gh-pages/documentup.min.jsl">See here</a>). You might need to wait a few minutes until you can see your docs in your Github pages URL.</p>

<p>And since I redirect my github profile page (from <a href="http://akbargumbira.github.io">http://akbargumbira.github.io</a> to <a href="http://www.akbargumbira.com">http://www.akbargumbira.com</a>), I can see my Django User Map docs at <a href="http://www.akbargumbira.com/django-user-map">http://www.akbargumbira.com/django-user-map</a>. Wspaniały, as Polish people say. Well, as long as I don't create a blog post with title 'Django User Map', it will be fine :)</p>

<p>So, if you have a project and want to make a simple docs out of the the repo's markdown file, this is a great choice. For now, it doesn't support private repository, multiple pages, or versioning. But if you go the DocumentUp issues list, the author is working on some of those already!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#Bragging: Polish Golden Owl on Duolingo]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>So, as you can see the title of this post, I just finished the Polish tree on Duolingo!

<p>How many lessons needed to finish the Polish tree? <br>
<img src="http://www.akbargumbira.com/content/images/2016/01/Screenshot-from-2016-01-26-21-35-13.png" alt="">
From the screenie above, I now have 2990 XP. It means that to finish the tree (without repeating any lesson), you need to finish 299 lessons, which I did in 26 days. I am not sure how much time it took me, but more or less I spent at least an hour in the morning and an hour at night every day.</p>

<p>I would say that it might be frustrating for someone who has no idea with Polish grammar. Well, bear in mind that even if you know the grammar, you will still get a headache when applying them. If you get the wrong case for noun, for example (In Polish there are 7 cases), Duolingo will not accept your answer. However, if you are keen enough, you can always find the resources related to the grammar online.</p>

<p>But anyway, the tree is perfect for someone like me. I am taking an intensive Polish course (click <a href="http://www.portal.pwr.wroc.pl/298563,242.dhtml">here</a> if you are interested with the programme) in Politechnika Wrocławska for a year (Hey PWr, I just endorsed you!). In 4 months, I think more or less the grammar aspects have been explained already (I just checked the tree, actually not all. I have not been explained these in the class and you'll find them in the tree: <em>verbal objects, gerund, participle, adverb comparison</em>). And since last month, I really wanted to 'exercise' my grammar. I went to book store to check some Polish novels and books, and it demotivated me. So I realized that it's not the time yet to read a full Polish novel :) </p>

<p>And I guess I will stick to Duolingo still for the next one month and start to subscribe to some Polish podcasts. I think I tend to rush in when it comes to learning. But learning a new language is different. I need to be patient and persistent, and make the right pace that does not demotivate or too slow for me.</p>

<p>So that's that, I hope I can make a good progress for the next 4 months and nail the B2 level test in June! :) </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Race with me on Duolingo!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>When I was on the bus from Bratislava to Wrocław, one of my friend was playing Duolingo learning Polish.

I was quite surprised to know Duolingo has it. Turns out that Duolingo has released its phase 2 of Polish course just 4 weeks ago (read <a href="https://incubator.duolingo.com/courses/pl/en/status">here</a>). It's not stable yet, but it's playable. I immediately grabbed my phone and started to play with the course.</p>

<p>After playing with it for a while and reading happy ending stories about people using Duolingo (read <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/comment/1834666">here</a> for one), I decided  to be more ambitious with it, taking it up as this year's resolution. To finish a course and get to level 25, apparently it needs 30k points. With one course worth 10 points, I estimated that if I am ambitious enough and persistent, I could finish it in 6 to 9 months. If I could finish it in 6 months, it would be perfect, as I will also finish my Polish course in Wrocław and take official Polish certification in June. And enjoy 3 months summer holiday afterwards :)</p>

<p>So if you have a goal to learn new languages too, follow me on Duolingo and I'll follow you back. Seeing something like this motivates you (to know that someone is learning harder than you), no? <br>

That's like mocking the beauty of math you know! In math, you can just understand one or two basic rules and from those rules, you can pretty much get anything by yourself. That's also one of the mistakes most people make when learning math. They just memorize things, "fast" methods, etc.</p>

<p>Last friday, I learned quantifier in Polish. Consider you want to say this (in present tense): "Some students read", in Polish it would be "Paru/parę studentów/studentek czyta". So, we need to apply Dopełniacz case to the student and always the third person singular for the verb. So, that's when I asked my teacher why it's using the third person singular verb while it's clear that the number of students there is plural. Why don't just use the verb based on the quantifier itself? Aaand she just said that most Poles also make that mistake. Yeaah sure, the only thing I could do now is to "memorize" this. Polish is just like math! #sarcasm</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Moving out to a private room]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Hmm, why did I want to move out from student dormitory in the first place?</p>

<p>You can just imagine how noisy and crowded it is from this arrangement in T3, one of the student dorms owned by Politechnika Wrocławska: <br>
In one hall there are 8 rooms, 1 kitchen, 2 showers, 3 toilets, and some bathroom sinks. One room is filled with 3 people. The room is about 5 meters long and 3 meters wide (and filled already with 2 wardrobes, 3 beds, a refrigerator, 3 tables, and 3 chairs)</p>

<p>It was super noisy in a way that my ears were constantly buzzing. I couldn't have 1 or 2 hours  quiet time to think, except for a night when I started to create this website. That was from 1am - 3am in the morning. The question is, don't the university think that we need some time for ourselves to think or work? We are all engineers and scientists. It's impossible to ask the students to be quiet all the time when it's that crowded already. I asked to move out to a double room several times without any result.</p>

<p>When I came here, I had some plans to work on some projects and join some online courses to prepare my 2nd year here. But that was only a plan when I was in the dorm. I couldn't even wake up in the morning for 7 minutes workout, listen to podcasts, or read some books. I always felt sleepy in the class, came late to the class, and felt really really bad about myself. So, I was in desperate mode to get myself back and to look for a better environment.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this month, I now live in single room in a shared apartment. Bear in mind that I am not exaggerating here. It's super hard to find a private room in Wrocław. I probably had contacted more than 50 people from the ads (from various websites: olx.pl, gumtree.pl, instancje.pl, etc). The rate the owner texted me back was perhaps around 1 every 10 texts. And most of them just told me that it's not available anymore. I was quite pessimistic.</p>

<p>Lucky me I got help from my language tandem friend (I teach her Bahasa Indonesia, she teaches me Polish). We just looked at 1 or 2-hour-old ads and phoned the owner directly. It turns out that looking for a single room here is really competitive. When I was looking around at the room, some people calling the owner and even there's one lady who came to see the room too. I decided to pay it right away. Or perhaps it's just an old school psychology trick? :)</p>

<p>So a tip for you when you want to rent a private room in Wrocław: You need to be able to speak Polish and call the owner right away. Or ask someone who can speak Polish to do it so. Oh another bummer is, even some owners only want someone who can speak Polish to rent their room.</p>

<p>So far, I've been enjoying my new environment. I start to wake up early again, do 7 minutes workout (and started doing 30 days Livit abs challenge - today is the 7th day), listen to podcasts before sleeping, and just started to read a novel again. The apartment is a 6-floors-building, so I can run up and down the stairs too now. I'm back!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Random Polish Thought: I see what you did there]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Languages are more or less 'defined' nowadays.

Some are evolving and some perhaps will remain the same for some centuries. But if you think about it, how does one language begin to exist?</p>

<p>That is one hell of a question right? Hmm, I start to think that Philology is one interesting study. Now, Let's talk about Polish.</p>

<p>I would say that Polish is one unique language. One of my lecturer said that it is very logical, another said that it's just like math. Yes, compared to other languages I know (Bahasa Indonesia, English, and Sundanese - I could read Arabic, but I don't understand it, so goes off the list), Polish is very grammatical; there are a lot of rules, and to speak it you really need to think. When one wants to say "I had bread with jam in the cafe", this is what happens in their mind more or less:</p>

<p><em>I am a man, so I need to use jeść with Ja and masculine case, so it's jadłem. Oh wait, I don't do this regularly, so I need to use dokonane case for that verb, zjadłem it is! Bread is chleb, easy peasy. Hmm, but I eat it with the jam. I need to apply narzędnik (instrumental) case for the jam. Jam in Polish is dzem, it's masculine, the narzednik case is dzemem. So bread with jam is chleb z dzemem. Cafe is kawiarnia in Polish. But it's locative case, I need to apply miejscownik. Hmm, it ends with n, that's a relief! There's no need to think if it's masculine, feminine, or neutral! So, in cafe is w kawiarnie! Let's recap, zjadłem chleb z dzemem w kawiarnie. Hmm, I hope this is correct. Let's tell the mouth to say it!</em></p>

<p>And finally you got that sentence out of your mouth. I don't know how much time I need to be able to speak it without thinking like that and let my mouth do the work :)</p>

<p>And you should know that Poles are really proud of the complexity of the Polish grammar. If they learn Bahasa Indonesia, they will probably raise their eyebrows knowing how simple it is (They probably find it hard to apply though as we don't really use formal language in everyday conversation). And I am really proud of Bahasa Indonesia too. It's so simple and yet we never feel that we're out of words or way to tell something. Well, I am talking about the general aspect of a language. Of course there are some words in other languages that would need a lot of explanation in other languages. Such example is with Sundanese, e.g there are some different single words to describe how you fall down - based on your position, how you fall, from where you fall, or how you sound when you fall (tijengkang, tigebruk, tikusruk, tikosewad, tijalikeuh, tigulitik, tigebrus, etc). Beautiful, no?</p>

<p>As we were talking about grammar, I believe that the ancient Poles don't really 'define' it. It's just how they sound. And then some Vikings wanted to learn it and they forced the ancient Poles to define the rules for them or else they will take the Poles to Uppsala and forced them to convert their faith. Sorry, I watched The Vikings too much! :)</p>

<p>Enough with grammar, let's talk about Polish vocabularies.</p>

<p>I couldn't remember how many times I said "Aaah, I see what you did there!" when I learned some new words. See how some Polish words are derived.</p>

<h5 id="daysinpolish"><strong>Days in Polish</strong></h5>

<p>Monday - Poniedziałek (Po = after) <br>
Tuesday - Wtorek (Wtóry = the second) <br>
Thursday - Środa (Srodek = middle) <br>
Friday - Piątek (Pięc = Five) <br>
Saturday - Sobota <br>
Sunday - Niedziela (Nie dzialać. Nie = No, dzialać = to work)</p>

<p>Sobota is very obvious from the sabbath jewish day and many languages use it too. </p>

<p>Now some random words</p>

<h5 id="blueandheaven"><strong>Blue and Heaven</strong></h5>

<p>Blue is Niebieski and Heaven is Niebie, what?? Let's assume that Poles 'invented' the color first before religion or faith. This is probably how they invented it:</p>

<p><em>A: "Hey you know what would happen after we die?"</em></p>

<p><em>B: "We probably go to that blue sky if we do good in this land (yes they probably only refer to what they live as land). That blue sky looks peaceful!"</em></p>

<p><em>C: "Taak, bardzo niebieski"</em></p>

<p><em>A: "Niebie!"</em></p>

<p><em>B and C: "Haaa niebie"</em></p>

<p><em>D: "Hey what's up? What are you guys talking about, niebie?"</em></p>

<h5 id="sunriseandsunset"><strong>Sunrise and Sunset</strong></h5>

<p>West is Zachód, East is Wschód, and Sun is     słońce. Guess what sunrise and sunset are in Polish? Sunrise is Wschód Słońca and Sunset is Zachód Słońca. I bet they are too lazy to define new words ah?</p>

<h5 id="treeanddoor"><strong>Tree and Door</strong></h5>

<p>Tree is Drzewo and Door is Drzwy. Yeah I guess no one used plastic doors back in the old days here.</p>

<h5 id="roomandpeace"><strong>Room and Peace</strong></h5>

<p>Pokój in Polish could mean 2 things: Room and Peace. Yeah makes sense, we're looking for some peace when we go back to our room.</p>

<p>This is TLDR already. The list could go on and on. What I could say is, Poles really like to play with prefixes, suffixes, literal meaning, or some associations. So far, it's fun to learn it!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cool Github is Cool: Embedding JSON Files Map]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It's nothing new that Github could render geojson files in our repository.

This day 1918, Poland was proclaimed as an independent country, after some series of partitions with Russia, Prussia, and Austria.</p>

<p>I would really like the idea to see and enjoy the festive celebrations and marches. But it seems that Poland is not really welcoming foreigners to enjoy today's celebration with them. Expats group and many people told me not to go outside especially when the so called 'Patriotic March' begins. Yeah, it's quite sad, compared to Independence day in Indonesia. We do a lot of fun things (balap karung, panjat pinang, makan kerupuk, etc) and we really welcome foreigners to see and enjoy those fun things.</p>

<p>It's kind of true that Poland is not welcoming foreigners as much as I thought. Foreigner was getting bullied in the tram (which has become a hot topic in Wrocław Expats group). Or as happened to me or my Indonesian friends, I couldn't remember how many times people 'scanned' me (you know when people 'really' look at your face), or people intentionally body-crashed my friend while walking, or how hard it is for me to find a private room because I don't speak Polish (yet). I am just a bit disappointed considering how rich and mixed European culture is, meanwhile some people can't just accept diversity.</p>

<p>But that's fine, I hope over time I can enjoy Poland more and for now I'll just enjoy Poland's Independence day by posing with its flag :)</p>

<p>Let's see what I do every weekdays now: </p>

<ul>
<li>Attending a 3 hours class</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it. I thought I could make another dot to make me look a bit busy :)</p>

<p><em>Then which part that makes me shocked? Isn't having more time everyone's wish?</em> </p>

<p>No. This is really unusual for me. I used to do things with specific timing - wake up, exercise, take shower, go to office, go back to home and do some private stuffs in the evening. That kind of routines also resulting in a better spent weekend. In short, with less time, I find myself less procrastinating.</p>

<p>Now, I feel like I have all the time in the world. And that's not good. For example, after waking up and having a thought to exercise, my brain says: "But you have time later after class. Let's go back to sleep again!". Repeat that every day and I realize now that I am making a bad habit already.</p>

<p>And it's not only about exercising. I'm procrastinating a lot to do some work too - thinking that I have time after class, or tomorrow morning, or weekend.</p>

<p>Moral of the story: We, human, should really get ourselves busy. Take any project we get offered, sign up to any clubs we like, make appointment here and there until we appreciate time more.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Random Polish Thought: Dziecko]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>As you know that I am learning Polish, I will probably post some random thoughts about this language over time.

Let's start with the first one.</p>

<p><strong>Inflected Part of Speech</strong></p>

<p>Some POS (Part of Speech) in Polish are inflected, means that their ending would change depending on subject, tenses, number, gender, or case. Those inflected POS are noun (<em>rzeczowniki</em>), adjective (<em>przymiotniki</em>), pronoun (<em>zaimki</em>), numeral (<em>liczebniki</em>), and verb (<em>czasowniki</em>). </p>

<p>Now, let's talk about adjective. Adjective is one of the inflected POS based on the gender of the subject or object that we describe. This is how the inflection works: <br>
<img src="http://www.akbargumbira.com/content/images/2015/10/adjective-1.png" alt="">
If it's masculine, then we need to inflect it to end with <em>y</em>. If the word ends with <em>k</em> or <em>g</em>, we inflect it to end with <em>i</em>. Simple enough.</p>

<p>Now, let's talk about dziecko (a child - which is neutral gender). When you describe a dziecko, you need to inflect the adjective with <em>-e</em>. So for example you want to say "My child is still small". In Polish it would be: "Moje dziecko jest jeszcze <em>małe</em>"</p>

<p>Now the random thought is, what if that dziecko wants to describe him/herself? Would the child use neutral adjective? or just based on his/her gender? Let's imagine for a while if it's actually the first one (I hope it's the later). There must be a time when he/she is grown enough to not be called a dziecko anymore. Is there a Poles' celebration for that? Or maybe dziecko definition is 'a kid who can't speak, or write yet'? Hmm, I really need to tell my brain to shut up :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome GhostBuster!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I've been wanting to use Ghost and statically publish it on Github pages since ages ago.

Finally now I have time to do this. Generating static pages using Buster, setting it up, and publishing it as Github pages is actually fast and seamless. Not sure why I didn't have time to do this before :)</p>

<p>So here it is, Ghost for the blogging platform, Buster for generating static pages, Github for hosting public static pages, BitBucket for hosting private Ghost sources, and the only thing I need is a domain. GhostBuster, They're here to save the world! :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
