Let's start with the first one.</p>

<p><strong>Inflected Part of Speech</strong></p>

<p>Some POS (Part of Speech) in Polish are inflected, means that their ending would change depending on subject, tenses, number, gender, or case. Those inflected POS are noun (<em>rzeczowniki</em>), adjective (<em>przymiotniki</em>), pronoun (<em>zaimki</em>), numeral (<em>liczebniki</em>), and verb (<em>czasowniki</em>). </p>

<p>Now, let's talk about adjective. Adjective is one of the inflected POS based on the gender of the subject or object that we describe. This is how the inflection works: <br>
<img src="http://www.akbargumbira.com/content/images/2015/10/adjective-1.png" alt="">
If it's masculine, then we need to inflect it to end with <em>y</em>. If the word ends with <em>k</em> or <em>g</em>, we inflect it to end with <em>i</em>. Simple enough.</p>

<p>Now, let's talk about dziecko (a child - which is neutral gender). When you describe a dziecko, you need to inflect the adjective with <em>-e</em>. So for example you want to say "My child is still small". In Polish it would be: "Moje dziecko jest jeszcze <em>ma≈Çe</em>"</p>

<p>Now the random thought is, what if that dziecko wants to describe him/herself? Would the child use neutral adjective? or just based on his/her gender? Let's imagine for a while if it's actually the first one (I hope it's the later). There must be a time when he/she is grown enough to not be called a dziecko anymore. Is there a Poles' celebration for that? Or maybe dziecko definition is 'a kid who can't speak, or write yet'? Hmm, I really need to tell my brain to shut up :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome GhostBuster!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I've been wanting to use Ghost and statically publish it on Github pages since ages ago.

Finally now I have time to do this. Generating static pages using Buster, setting it up, and publishing it as Github pages is actually fast and seamless. Not sure why I didn't have time to do this before :)</p>

<p>So here it is, Ghost for the blogging platform, Buster for generating static pages, Github for hosting public static pages, BitBucket for hosting private Ghost sources, and the only thing I need is a domain. GhostBuster, They're here to save the world! :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
