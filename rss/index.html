In one of the labs, the students are asked to generate sequences of independent observation of random variables following some true distributions. An example of the tasks is generating sequences uniformly within unit circle and plot the marginal distribution f(x). Here is the plot of the true distribution (the plot on top of the screenshot below) compared to the 1000 randomly generated samples (the plot at the bottom): <br>
<img src="http://www.akbargumbira.com/content/images/2016/11/ta.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It's so satisfying for me to see that all those generated samples follow the distribution asked. I know that it's quite naive, I draw samples from the defined distribution itself using some methods (Inverse CDF, Rejection Method, or Box Muller Transforms). So, if the generated samples don't follow the distribution from which the samples are obtained, there must be something wrong with my work :)</p>

<p>But, think of it this way: Have you ever heard that the number of goals in football match follows Poisson Distribution? How the hell do people conclude this? The answer is to reverse what I did on my lab: People observed over time and treated it as independent observations. Of course in one match, we can't really predict the number of goals, but we can say some numbers are more likely to happen than the other numbers. That is what "stochastic" really is.</p>

<p>So next time you are intrigued by one event, take observations of the event and see if you can really see the patterns. Random events might not as random as you think.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Releasing QGIS Resource Sharing Plugin]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Finally, Google Summer of Code coding period has ended last week.

My project is under OSGeo organization working on QGIS. The proposal is to make a tool that allows QGIS users to share SVG, symbols and colorramps, and styles easily. Just a few days ago I released the plugin with version 0.5. So please, go ahead open your QGIS and install the plugin!</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>In the beginning, I proposed a rather conventional system: web service based architecture and implementing the client in the QGIS. In the community bonding period, we did some brainstorming and decided to go with a directory based repository where users can put the repository basically everywhere rather than putting the resources on our server.</p>

<p>If you want to know the project in a 5-minutes presentation, please read this slide here: <a href="http://www.akbargumbira.com/slide_gsoc2016">Final Report - Presentation</a> (don't worry, it's a webpage for your convenience)</p>

<h4 id="sowhatcanidowiththeplugin">So, what can I do with the plugin?</h4>

<p>As I mentioned earlier that with this plugins, users should be able to download collections available from the repositories. The list of repositories is registered in the Settings tab. There are only 7 collections available now, which is not that great :) <br>
<img src="http://www.akbargumbira.com/content/images/2016/08/mapbox-maki.png" alt=""></p>

<h4 id="ihaveresourcesiwanttosharehowcanisharemine">I have resources I want to share, how can I share mine?</h4>

<p>I have made the documentation on how to create a repository and publish it. Please read here <a href="http://www.akbargumbira.com/qgis_resources_sharing">QGIS Resource Sharing - Documentation</a>. Please check that page and read the 'For Authors' section. Contact me (by email or even create an issue in the github repository) if there is anything unclear.</p>

<p>Like any system that relies on its data, this tool would be useless if there's nothing interesting there  for users to install. Hopefully QGIS users will start to use this tool to share resources among users. So please, encourage your friends who make cool maps to make a repository for the betterment of QGIS! :)</p>

<h4 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h4>

<p>I know that I say thanks a lot, but to show that I really appreciate their helps, I will just say it here again :) </p>

<p>Thanks to my mentors (Alessandro Pasotti and Anita Graser) for their constant helps on giving me feedback. Richard Duivenvoorde for the idea with the directory-based repository and involve himself into this project in many ways. Also for showing me his cool hackerspace in Den Haag and taking me to an Indonesian restaurant there. After one year living in Poland, I was so excited to see so many tasteful Indonesian dishes that I couldn't decide which one to choose. Tim Sutton for his feedbacks and comments from the beginning. Martin Dobias and Nyall Dawson for their technical input.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[GSOC #1: Defining Scope and Hackfest]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>GSoC coding period has started since last week.

During the community bonding period and coding period last week, I spent my time to define the specification for the project. At the beginning of the community period, I posted a QEP (QGIS Enhancement Proposal) <a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/58">here</a> to get feedback from the community. The idea of sharing resources was to have a symbology store (symbology being symbol, style, and SVG). So user should be able to browse those resources in QGIS and download it as an item. Having thought that the idea won't change that much, I started to work a bit on the server side on the deployment stuffs with docker and authentication part. This was not a good idea though as later we decided to change the concept. </p>

<p>Richard and Tim came up with an idea to use git as the platform for the repositories as we already have resources lying around in github repositories and Richard thinks that it's too much for a GSoC job to implement the backend stuffs and the tool itself in QGIS. We had a skype chat and I spent a day to just think about it and started to make a new documentation to put my thoughts about it. </p>

<p>We discussed about the concept and the more we discussed the bigger the scope of the project is. Until just tomorrow, we haven't really decided on the scope that I should implement. Lucky for me that QGIS hackfest also started last week. I attended the hackfest to discuss this with my mentors (Ale, Anita), Richard, Tim, and others as well who are interested on this project. These are general scope of the project:</p>

<h5 id="retrievingcollections">Retrieving Collections</h5>

<p>The tool should be able to retrieve collections from the remote repository. Collection is a set of resources (SVGs, Symbols, styles, colorramps, etc) that belongs together that can be used to create a coherent map design. We also define that one collection should be self-sufficient, meaning that the collection contains all the resources needed and doesn't use resources from other collections. This is the highest priority of the GSoC. We will also create an official collections repository as a default.</p>

<h5 id="importingcollections">Importing Collections</h5>

<p>After downloading collections, the tool should import the downloaded collections based on its type so that QGIS users can use the collections right away (for now Symbol and SVG are the priority)</p>

<h5 id="discoveringavailablerepositories">Discovering Available Repositories</h5>

<p>So as users can make their collection repositories on their own, there needs to be a way for the tools to know the available repositories out there to suggest users when they register a repository source in their QGIS. The simplest way is that we make a text file in the official repository and ask people to make a PR if they want their collections suggested on the tools. A better one is to make a web service so users can register their repositories there. </p>

<h5 id="managingmetadata">Managing Metadata</h5>

<p>It's nice for users if they can manage the metadata easily before they share the repository so the metadata is defined correctly. But this is not a high priority as users can define the metadata manually.</p>

<h5 id="sharingrepository">Sharing Repository</h5>

<p>It would be nice for users to be able to share their local repository to the git platform from the tools. This is not a high priority as we think that it would take time as we don't want to restrict ourselves only to Github.</p>

<h5 id="managinglocalrepository">Managing Local Repository</h5>

<p>Before sharing repositories, it would be cool if users can add stuffs (reminding the dependencies if it's not there) or remove stuffs (again telling the users if it's used by other resources). We agreed that this is not a high priority during this GSoC.</p>

<p>If you want to know more details, you can see the doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ETuLBTx5IjVejB8TQPjjsMWBcUQO6pIKrNSrAZUApo/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>

<h3 id="hackfest">Hackfest</h3>

<p>This is my first hackfest experience. There are a lot of interesting stuffs the developers are working on (Martin creating a debugging plugin for plugin, Matthias' work on testing framework so that plugin developers don't need to mock things up for their tests, Sandro Mani developing a 'version' of QGIS with super nice UI/UX, and so on so forth). Ale and I also managed to deploy the plugin site with the new user map that had been in the PR lists for quite some time. I didn't manage to look at my PR again for dockerizing the deployment though so that Ale or Tim can deploy it.</p>

<p>These are some photos taken from the hackfest <br>

<p><img src="http://www.akbargumbira.com/content/images/2016/04/gsoc.png" alt="alt"></p>

<p>Someone actually did that for GSoC 2013, but it was not merged into production. Last year, Tim told me about this work and asked me if perhaps I would be interested to continue the work. So, I started to hack around QGIS Django project. As an attempt to familiarize myself with the code base, I actually worked on other stuffs instead of that sharing feature :) I made PR to dockerize deployment, went to each issues in Redmine, and replaced the user map with my Django User Map.  About two months ago, Tim poked me again about this and told me that if I need help, ideas, and suggestions, Anita and Richard are happy to help. I started to dig around the work again.</p>

<p>My plan for summer break was to work here (as a student in Poland, I'm allowed to work full time in the summer break). Until one day I had a thought: "Why didn't I apply for GSoC and submit the proposal for that QGIS work?". I checked the website and luckily the registration was still open. A few days after the registration, Ale (Alessandro Pasotti) contacted me if I would like to have him as a mentor along with Anita (of course I said yes). So, now I have 2 official mentors and 1 unofficial one that I keep poking around (Tim) and use his server for staging :)</p>

<p>Official coding time starts on May 23rd, because apparently most of the universities out there have summer break started around that date, except for Poland. Poland academic calendar is one-month late. Winter semester starts in October and summer break starts around the end of June. I think I will stay here in Poland until August to work for GSoC, and back to Indonesia in September. I am not sure if I can focus to work on the project if I stay in Indonesia. </p>

<p>It's a great chance for me to learn and contribute for QGIS. I hope I can do this project well :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Releasing Django User Map v1.0.0]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Wohoo, finally I just released Django User Map v.1.0.0 after some work since 2 or 3 weeks ago!

Click   <a href="http://www.akbargumbira.com/django-user-map">documentation</a> to read the docs.</p>

<p><em>What have been changed from the previous one?</em></p>

<p><strong>Removing Custom User Model</strong></p>

<p>A bit of history, at first <a href="http://www.twitter.com/timlinux">Tim Sutton</a> and I created the Flask version <a href="https://github.com/kartoza/flask_user_map">here</a>. It was a simple flask app with only sqlite to save users. For the online version of it, Python Indonesia is using this project here <a href="http://members.python.or.id/">Python Indonesia User Map</a>. As we needed some more features and wanted to make InaSAFE Realtime more like a web app, we created django project for all InaSAFE web related project. So the first thing I did was to re-implement the User Map with Django. </p>

<p>We wanted to still keep the users from the Flask User Map and migrate them to the new Django one. The Flask User Map is using an email for user to register themselves. That's why I created a custom user model with its own authentication backend. Actually in the end, we didn't migrate the users and only e-mail the old users to register on the new site :) There were other fields (InaSAFE, OSM roles, password) that weren't available from the previous one. So, instead of migrating them with a lot of default values, we decided to just mass email them.</p>

<p>But, the custom user model has made this apps not reusable for others to plug the apps on their existing django projects. So, after some thoughts, I decided to get rid of that and make Django User Map extend the auth user model defined for the project. This is making Django User Map really simple now as it doesn't care what the user model looks like, or how the authentication backend works. As the users need to log in before adding/updating themselves on the user map, the only thing I need to know is the login view of the project. This must be defined in the user map setting. Read here <a href="http://www.akbargumbira.com/django-user-map/#login-view">Login View</a></p>

<p><strong>Using REST API</strong></p>

<p>I was just thinking that this resource could be useful for others to use. Right now GET is the only operation allowed, returning geojson of the users.</p>

<p><strong>New marker filter control</strong></p>

<p>Users can select multiple roles for themselves. Therefore, I couldn't cheat filtering user based on roles using Leaflet overlay control. So, I made a custom filter control for that.</p>

<p><strong>Make settings more compliant with Leaflet</strong></p>

<p>For the basemap and marker icon, users (I meant, who plug Django User Map  on their Django project), can pass options using the exact same L.tiles and L.icon options. You can just pass any valid options of them in the setting. Read <a href="http://www.akbargumbira.com/django-user-map/#marker">here for marker</a> and <a href="http://www.akbargumbira.com/django-user-map/#map-configuration">here for basemap</a></p>

<p><strong>Allow users to override data privacy content and add navigation menu</strong></p>

<p>This is made possible through the Django template loading mechanism. You can override the data privacy content (<a href="http://www.akbargumbira.com/django-user-map/#data-privacy">read here</a>) or add navigation menu (<a href="http://www.akbargumbira.com/django-user-map/#navigation">read here</a>)</p>

<p>See below how Django User map looks like when we add navigation menu: <br>
<img src="http://www.akbargumbira.com/content/images/2016/03/with_nav.png" alt="With Navigation"></p>

<p>For the navigation, unfortunately I am not quite satisfied with it. There are some matters that I was not quite sure. One of them is whether to have the base template of User Map extend the base template of the django project or not. With this option, there are a lot of other variables unknown, such as the name of the blocks to put User Map components.</p>

<p>So what I did right now is to use <code>include</code>. So the navigation defined in project's template will be included to the template in user map. As the user map uses Bootstrap 3, users can just use style classes or other component from Bootstrap 3. This is also a drawback for example when users already have their own template for navigation menu, and they use Bootstrap 2. This is the problem I found when I tried to plug Django User Map in to QGIS Django. I tried using scoped styling, but it apparently does not work for all browsers. And it was actually hard to use Bootstrap 3 and make it look like as if it uses Boostrap 2. So, users who have this problem perhaps could just not use the navigation menu. Drop me some comments if you have suggestion!</p>

<p><strong>Made popup content dynamically generated</strong></p>

<p>Basically what you defined on the setting for <code>api_user_field</code> will be shown on the popup content and on the API. You pick what you want to show yourself!</p>

<p><strong>Some other stuffs</strong></p>

<p>Small stuffs but taking quite an effort, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Utilising class based views. The first time I worked back on the code, I was embarassed by myself reading my own code :)</li>
<li>Having a nice documentation: <a href="http://www.akbargumbira.com/django-user-map">This is a cool docs</a></li>
<li>Rendering popup content in client side using jsRender. Yeah users nowadays have abundant resources of their computers. So why should we render for them on the server side? :) </li>
</ul>

<p><em>What is the next plan?</em></p>

<p>I want to let users who don't use spatial backend  on their django project to be able to plug this apps as well. I need to look first at some options like django-geojson.</p>

<p>So, if you have Django project, try to plug this Django User Map, and let me know if you have some problems or patches! #ShamelessPlug</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[DocumentUp: Generate docs from your markdown file(s)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>While at the lab in a class this afternoon, I was looking for a simple way to document my side project, <a href="https://github.com/akbargumbira/django-user-map">Django User Map</a>.

<p>It's so simple to set up that you can just try it right away right now! Pick one of your public Github repository and go to <a href="http://documentup.com/your-username/the-repository">http://documentup.com/your-username/the-repository</a> to see how your docs look like.</p>

<p>We can also use Github Pages for our repository and get the docs rendered at <a href="http://your-username.github.io/the-repository">http://your-username.github.io/the-repository</a>. To get this working, you need to create <code>gh-pages</code> branch in your repository first and create <code>index.html</code> (<a href="https://github.com/akbargumbira/django-user-map/blob/gh-pages/index.html">See here</a>) and <code>documentup.min.js</code> (<a href="https://github.com/akbargumbira/django-user-map/blob/gh-pages/documentup.min.jsl">See here</a>). You might need to wait a few minutes until you can see your docs in your Github pages URL.</p>

<p>And since I redirect my github profile page (from <a href="http://akbargumbira.github.io">http://akbargumbira.github.io</a> to <a href="http://www.akbargumbira.com">http://www.akbargumbira.com</a>), I can see my Django User Map docs at <a href="http://www.akbargumbira.com/django-user-map">http://www.akbargumbira.com/django-user-map</a>. Wspaniały, as Polish people say. Well, as long as I don't create a blog post with title 'Django User Map', it will be fine :)</p>

<p>So, if you have a project and want to make a simple docs out of the the repo's markdown file, this is a great choice. For now, it doesn't support private repository, multiple pages, or versioning.

<p>How many lessons needed to finish the Polish tree? <br>
<img src="http://www.akbargumbira.com/content/images/2016/01/Screenshot-from-2016-01-26-21-35-13.png" alt="">
From the screenie above, I now have 2990 XP. It means that to finish the tree (without repeating any lesson), you need to finish 299 lessons, which I did in 26 days. I am not sure how much time it took me, but more or less I spent at least an hour in the morning and an hour at night every day.</p>

<p>I would say that it might be frustrating for someone who has no idea with Polish grammar. Well, bear in mind that even if you know the grammar, you will still get a headache when applying them. If you get the wrong case for noun, for example (In Polish there are 7 cases), Duolingo will not accept your answer. However, if you are keen enough, you can always find the resources related to the grammar online.</p>

<p>But anyway, the tree is perfect for someone like me. I am taking an intensive Polish course (click <a href="http://www.portal.pwr.wroc.pl/298563,242.dhtml">here</a> if you are interested with the programme) in Politechnika Wrocławska for a year (Hey PWr, I just endorsed you!). In 4 months, I think more or less the grammar aspects have been explained already (I just checked the tree, actually not all. I have not been explained these in the class and you'll find them in the tree: <em>verbal objects, gerund, participle, adverb comparison</em>). And since last month, I really wanted to 'exercise' my grammar. I went to book store to check some Polish novels and books, and it demotivated me. So I realized that it's not the time yet to read a full Polish novel :) </p>

<p>And I guess I will stick to Duolingo still for the next one month and start to subscribe to some Polish podcasts. I think I tend to rush in when it comes to learning. But learning a new language is different. I need to be patient and persistent, and make the right pace that does not demotivate or too slow for me.</p>

<p>So that's that, I hope I can make a good progress for the next 4 months and nail the B2 level test in June! :) </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Race with me on Duolingo!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>When I was on the bus from Bratislava to Wrocław, one of my friend was playing Duolingo learning Polish.

I was quite surprised to know Duolingo has it. Turns out that Duolingo has released its phase 2 of Polish course just 4 weeks ago (read <a href="https://incubator.duolingo.com/courses/pl/en/status">here</a>). It's not stable yet, but it's playable. I immediately grabbed my phone and started to play with the course.</p>

<p>After playing with it for a while and reading happy ending stories about people using Duolingo (read <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/comment/1834666">here</a> for one), I decided  to be more ambitious with it, taking it up as this year's resolution. To finish a course and get to level 25, apparently it needs 30k points. With one course worth 10 points, I estimated that if I am ambitious enough and persistent, I could finish it in 6 to 9 months. If I could finish it in 6 months, it would be perfect, as I will also finish my Polish course in Wrocław and take official Polish certification in June. And enjoy 3 months summer holiday afterwards :)</p>

<p>So if you have a goal to learn new languages too, follow me on Duolingo and I'll follow you back. Seeing something like this motivates you (to know that someone is learning harder than you), no? <br>

That's like mocking the beauty of math you know! In math, you can just understand one or two basic rules and from those rules, you can pretty much get anything by yourself. That's also one of the mistakes most people make when learning math. They just memorize things, "fast" methods, etc.</p>

<p>Last friday, I learned quantifier in Polish. Consider you want to say this (in present tense): "Some students read", in Polish it would be "Paru/parę studentów/studentek czyta". So, we need to apply Dopełniacz case to the student and always the third person singular for the verb. So, that's when I asked my teacher why it's using the third person singular verb while it's clear that the number of students there is plural. Why don't just use the verb based on the quantifier itself? Aaand she just said that most Poles also make that mistake. Yeaah sure, the only thing I could do now is to "memorize" this. Polish is just like math! #sarcasm</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Moving out to a private room]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Hmm, why did I want to move out from student dormitory in the first place?</p>

<p>You can just imagine how noisy and crowded it is from this arrangement in T3, one of the student dorms owned by Politechnika Wrocławska: <br>
In one hall there are 8 rooms, 1 kitchen, 2 showers, 3 toilets, and some bathroom sinks. One room is filled with 3 people. The room is about 5 meters long and 3 meters wide (and filled already with 2 wardrobes, 3 beds, a refrigerator, 3 tables, and 3 chairs)</p>

<p>It was super noisy in a way that my ears were constantly buzzing. I couldn't have 1 or 2 hours  quiet time to think, except for a night when I started to create this website. That was from 1am - 3am in the morning. The question is, don't the university think that we need some time for ourselves to think or work? We are all engineers and scientists. It's impossible to ask the students to be quiet all the time when it's that crowded already. I asked to move out to a double room several times without any result.</p>

<p>When I came here, I had some plans to work on some projects and join some online courses to prepare my 2nd year here. But that was only a plan when I was in the dorm. I couldn't even wake up in the morning for 7 minutes workout, listen to podcasts, or read some books. I always felt sleepy in the class, came late to the class, and felt really really bad about myself. So, I was in desperate mode to get myself back and to look for a better environment.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this month, I now live in single room in a shared apartment. Bear in mind that I am not exaggerating here. It's super hard to find a private room in Wrocław. I probably had contacted more than 50 people from the ads (from various websites: olx.pl, gumtree.pl, instancje.pl, etc). The rate the owner texted me back was perhaps around 1 every 10 texts. And most of them just told me that it's not available anymore. I was quite pessimistic.</p>

<p>Lucky me I got help from my language tandem friend (I teach her Bahasa Indonesia, she teaches me Polish). We just looked at 1 or 2-hour-old ads and phoned the owner directly. It turns out that looking for a single room here is really competitive. When I was looking around at the room, some people calling the owner and even there's one lady who came to see the room too. I decided to pay it right away. Or perhaps it's just an old school psychology trick? :)</p>

<p>So a tip for you when you want to rent a private room in Wrocław: You need to be able to speak Polish and call the owner right away. Or ask someone who can speak Polish to do it so. Oh another bummer is, even some owners only want someone who can speak Polish to rent their room.</p>

<p>So far, I've been enjoying my new environment. I start to wake up early again, do 7 minutes workout (and started doing 30 days Livit abs challenge - today is the 7th day), listen to podcasts before sleeping, and just started to read a novel again. The apartment is a 6-floors-building, so I can run up and down the stairs too now. I'm back!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Random Polish Thought: I see what you did there]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Languages are more or less 'defined' nowadays.

Some are evolving and some perhaps will remain the same for some centuries. But if you think about it, how does one language begin to exist?</p>

<p>That is one hell of a question right? Hmm, I start to think that Philology is one interesting study. Now, Let's talk about Polish.</p>

<p>I would say that Polish is one unique language. One of my lecturer said that it is very logical, another said that it's just like math. Yes, compared to other languages I know (Bahasa Indonesia, English, and Sundanese - I could read Arabic, but I don't understand it, so goes off the list), Polish is very grammatical; there are a lot of rules, and to speak it you really need to think. When one wants to say "I had bread with jam in the cafe", this is what happens in their mind more or less:</p>

<p><em>I am a man, so I need to use jeść with Ja and masculine case, so it's jadłem. Oh wait, I don't do this regularly, so I need to use dokonane case for that verb, zjadłem it is! Bread is chleb, easy peasy. Hmm, but I eat it with the jam. I need to apply narzędnik (instrumental) case for the jam. Jam in Polish is dzem, it's masculine, the narzednik case is dzemem. So bread with jam is chleb z dzemem. Cafe is kawiarnia in Polish. But it's locative case, I need to apply miejscownik. Hmm, it ends with n, that's a relief! There's no need to think if it's masculine, feminine, or neutral! So, in cafe is w kawiarnie! Let's recap, zjadłem chleb z dzemem w kawiarnie. Hmm, I hope this is correct. Let's tell the mouth to say it!</em></p>

<p>And finally you got that sentence out of your mouth. I don't know how much time I need to be able to speak it without thinking like that and let my mouth do the work :)</p>

<p>And you should know that Poles are really proud of the complexity of the Polish grammar. If they learn Bahasa Indonesia, they will probably raise their eyebrows knowing how simple it is (They probably find it hard to apply though as we don't really use formal language in everyday conversation). And I am really proud of Bahasa Indonesia too. It's so simple and yet we never feel that we're out of words or way to tell something. Well, I am talking about the general aspect of a language. Of course there are some words in other languages that would need a lot of explanation in other languages. Such example is with Sundanese, e.g there are some different single words to describe how you fall down - based on your position, how you fall, from where you fall, or how you sound when you fall (tijengkang, tigebruk, tikusruk, tikosewad, tijalikeuh, tigulitik, tigebrus, etc). Beautiful, no?</p>

<p>As we were talking about grammar, I believe that the ancient Poles don't really 'define' it. It's just how they sound. And then some Vikings wanted to learn it and they forced the ancient Poles to define the rules for them or else they will take the Poles to Uppsala and forced them to convert their faith. Sorry, I watched The Vikings too much! :)</p>

<p>Enough with grammar, let's talk about Polish vocabularies.</p>

<p>I couldn't remember how many times I said "Aaah, I see what you did there!" when I learned some new words. See how some Polish words are derived.</p>

<h5 id="daysinpolish"><strong>Days in Polish</strong></h5>

<p>Monday - Poniedziałek (Po = after) <br>
Tuesday - Wtorek (Wtóry = the second) <br>
Thursday - Środa (Srodek = middle) <br>
Friday - Piątek (Pięc = Five) <br>
Saturday - Sobota <br>
Sunday - Niedziela (Nie dzialać. Nie = No, dzialać = to work)</p>

<p>Sobota is very obvious from the sabbath jewish day and many languages use it too. </p>

<p>Now some random words</p>

<h5 id="blueandheaven"><strong>Blue and Heaven</strong></h5>

<p>Blue is Niebieski and Heaven is Niebie, what?? Let's assume that Poles 'invented' the color first before religion or faith. This is probably how they invented it:</p>

<p><em>A: "Hey you know what would happen after we die?"</em></p>

<p><em>B: "We probably go to that blue sky if we do good in this land (yes they probably only refer to what they live as land). That blue sky looks peaceful!"</em></p>

<p><em>C: "Taak, bardzo niebieski"</em></p>

<p><em>A: "Niebie!"</em></p>

<p><em>B and C: "Haaa niebie"</em></p>

<p><em>D: "Hey what's up? What are you guys talking about, niebie?"</em></p>

<h5 id="sunriseandsunset"><strong>Sunrise and Sunset</strong></h5>

<p>West is Zachód, East is Wschód, and Sun is     słońce. Guess what sunrise and sunset are in Polish? Sunrise is Wschód Słońca and Sunset is Zachód Słońca. I bet they are too lazy to define new words ah?</p>

<h5 id="treeanddoor"><strong>Tree and Door</strong></h5>

<p>Tree is Drzewo and Door is Drzwy. Yeah I guess no one used plastic doors back in the old days here.</p>

<h5 id="roomandpeace"><strong>Room and Peace</strong></h5>

<p>Pokój in Polish could mean 2 things: Room and Peace. Yeah makes sense, we're looking for some peace when we go back to our room.</p>

<p>This is TLDR already. The list could go on and on. What I could say is, Poles really like to play with prefixes, suffixes, literal meaning, or some associations. So far, it's fun to learn it!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cool Github is Cool: Embedding JSON Files Map]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It's nothing new that Github could render geojson files in our repository.

This day 1918, Poland was proclaimed as an independent country, after some series of partitions with Russia, Prussia, and Austria.</p>

<p>I would really like the idea to see and enjoy the festive celebrations and marches. But it seems that Poland is not really welcoming foreigners to enjoy today's celebration with them. Expats group and many people told me not to go outside especially when the so called 'Patriotic March' begins. Yeah, it's quite sad, compared to Independence day in Indonesia. We do a lot of fun things (balap karung, panjat pinang, makan kerupuk, etc) and we really welcome foreigners to see and enjoy those fun things.</p>

<p>It's kind of true that Poland is not welcoming foreigners as much as I thought. Foreigner was getting bullied in the tram (which has become a hot topic in Wrocław Expats group). Or as happened to me or my Indonesian friends, I couldn't remember how many times people 'scanned' me (you know when people 'really' look at your face), or people intentionally body-crashed my friend while walking, or how hard it is for me to find a private room because I don't speak Polish (yet). I am just a bit disappointed considering how rich and mixed European culture is, meanwhile some people can't just accept diversity.</p>

<p>But that's fine, I hope over time I can enjoy Poland more and for now I'll just enjoy Poland's Independence day by posing with its flag :)</p>

It's really logical though. We are more appreciative about time when we have it less (we could generalize "time" to anything valuable e.g money).</p>

<p>Let's see what I do every weekdays now: </p>

<ul>
<li>Attending a 3 hours class</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it. I thought I could make another dot to make me look a bit busy :)</p>

<p><em>Then which part that makes me shocked? Isn't having more time everyone's wish?</em> </p>

<p>No. This is really unusual for me. I used to do things with specific timing - wake up, exercise, take shower, go to office, go back to home and do some private stuffs in the evening. That kind of routines also resulting in a better spent weekend. In short, with less time, I find myself less procrastinating.</p>

<p>Now, I feel like I have all the time in the world. And that's not good. For example, after waking up and having a thought to exercise, my brain says: "But you have time later after class. Let's go back to sleep again!". Repeat that every day and I realize now that I am making a bad habit already.</p>

<p>And it's not only about exercising. I'm procrastinating a lot to do some work too - thinking that I have time after class, or tomorrow morning, or weekend.</p>

<p>Moral of the story: We, human, should really get ourselves busy. Take any project we get offered, sign up to any clubs we like, make appointment here and there until we appreciate time more.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
