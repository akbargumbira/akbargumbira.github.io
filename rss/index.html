<p>But Github doesn't just stop there to please developers. They make many stuffs embeddable. I don't want to explain how to do that, you can just read it <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/#embedding-your-map-elsewhere">here</a>. No, it's not only map that you can embed in your website, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/3d-file-viewer/#embedding-your-model-elsewhere">3D files too!</a> Probably there are other stuffs too that we can embed from github :)</p>

<p>Here is the example, a map of QGIS Contributors from the JSON files in its repository.</p>

This day 1918, Poland was proclaimed as an independent country, after some series of partitions with Russia, Prussia, and Austria.</p>

<p>I would really like the idea to see and enjoy the festive celebrations and marches. But it seems that Poland is not really welcoming foreigners to enjoy today's celebration with them. Expats group and many people told me not to go outside especially when the so called 'Patriotic March' begins. Yeah, it's quite sad, compared to Independence day in Indonesia. We do a lot of fun things (balap karung, panjat pinang, makan kerupuk, etc) and we really welcome foreigners to see and enjoy those fun things.</p>

<p>It's kind of true that Poland is not welcoming foreigners as much as I thought. Foreigner was getting bullied in the tram (which has become a hot topic in Wroc≈Çaw Expats group). Or as happened to me or my Indonesian friends, I couldn't remember how many times people 'scanned' me (you know when people 'really' look at your face), or people intentionally body-crashed my friend while walking, or how hard it is for me to find a private room because I don't speak Polish (yet). I am just a bit disappointed considering how rich and mixed European culture is, meanwhile some people can't just accept diversity.</p>

<p>But that's fine, I hope over time I can enjoy Poland more and for now I'll just enjoy Poland's Independence day by posing with its flag :)</p>

<p>Just 2 hours ago, I stumbled upon that lolcommits directory in my mindpalace (red: my laptop). The images were captured for almost 3 months, from March 18th until June 9th. And I should've activated lolcommits for my work in Labster (activating lolcommits for this web now :) )</p>

<p>I was thinking that it might be fun to make a video out of it. I found <a href="https://gist.github.com/rowan-m/4118361">a handy bash script</a> and just use it. Works like a charm. So, here is the video.</p>

It's really logical though. We are more appreciative about time when we have it less (we could generalize "time" to anything valuable e.g money).</p>

<p>Let's see what I do every weekdays now: </p>

<ul>
<li>Attending a 3 hours class</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it. I thought I could make another dot to make me look a bit busy :)</p>

<p><em>Then which part that makes me shocked? Isn't having more time everyone's wish?</em> </p>

<p>No. This is really unusual for me. I used to do things with specific timing - wake up, exercise, take shower, go to office, go back to home and do some private stuffs in the evening. That kind of routines also resulting in a better spent weekend. In short, with less time, I find myself less procrastinating.</p>

<p>Now, I feel like I have all the time in the world. And that's not good. For example, after waking up and having a thought to exercise, my brain says: "But you have time later after class. Let's go back to sleep again!". Repeat that every day and I realize now that I am making a bad habit already.</p>

<p>And it's not only about exercising. I'm procrastinating a lot to do some work too - thinking that I have time after class, or tomorrow morning, or weekend.</p>

<p>Moral of the story: We, human, should really get ourselves busy. Take any project we get offered, sign up to any clubs we like, make appointment here and there until we appreciate time more.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Random Polish Thought: Dziecko]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>As you know that I am learning Polish, I will probably post some random thoughts about this language over time.

Let's start with the first one.</p>

<p><strong>Inflected Part of Speech</strong></p>

<p>Some POS (Part of Speech) in Polish are inflected, means that their ending would change depending on subject, tenses, number, gender, or case. Those inflected POS are noun (<em>rzeczowniki</em>), adjective (<em>przymiotniki</em>), pronoun (<em>zaimki</em>), numeral (<em>liczebniki</em>), and verb (<em>czasowniki</em>). </p>

<p>Now, let's talk about adjective. Adjective is one of the inflected POS based on the gender of the subject or object that we describe. This is how the inflection works: <br>
<img src="http://www.akbargumbira.com/content/images/2015/10/adjective-1.png" alt="">
If it's masculine, then we need to inflect it to end with <em>y</em>. If the word ends with <em>k</em> or <em>g</em>, we inflect it to end with <em>i</em>. Simple enough.</p>

<p>Now, let's talk about dziecko (a child - which is neutral gender). When you describe a dziecko, you need to inflect the adjective with <em>-e</em>. So for example you want to say "My child is still small". In Polish it would be: "Moje dziecko jest jeszcze <em>ma≈Çe</em>"</p>

<p>Now the random thought is, what if that dziecko wants to describe him/herself? Would the child use neutral adjective? or just based on his/her gender? Let's imagine for a while if it's actually the first one (I hope it's the later). There must be a time when he/she is grown enough to not be called a dziecko anymore. Is there a Poles' celebration for that? Or maybe dziecko definition is 'a kid who can't speak, or write yet'? Hmm, I really need to tell my brain to shut up :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome GhostBuster!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I've been wanting to use Ghost and statically publish it on Github pages since ages ago.

<p>So here it is, Ghost for the blogging platform, Buster for generating static pages, Github for hosting public static pages, BitBucket for hosting private Ghost sources, and the only thing I need is a domain.
