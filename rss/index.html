It's really logical though. We are more appreciative about time when we have it less (we could generalize "time" to anything valuable e.g money).</p>

<p>Let's see what I do every weekdays now: </p>

<ul>
<li>Attending a 3 hours class</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it. I thought I could make another dot to make me look a bit busy :)</p>

<p><em>Then which part that makes me shocked? Isn't having more time everyone's wish?</em> </p>

<p>No. This is really unusual for me. I used to do things with specific timing - wake up, exercise, take shower, go to office, go back to home and do some private stuffs in the evening. That kind of routines also resulting in a better spent weekend. In short, with less time, I find myself less procrastinating.</p>

<p>Now, I feel like I have all the time in the world. And that's not good. For example, after waking up and having a thought to exercise, my brain says: "But you have time later after class. Let's go back to sleep again!". Repeat that every day and I realize now that I am making a bad habit already.</p>

<p>And it's not only about exercising. I'm procrastinating a lot to do some work too - thinking that I have time after class, or tomorrow morning, or weekend.</p>

<p>Moral of the story: We, human, should really get ourselves busy. Take any project we get offered, sign up to any clubs we like, make appointment here and there until we appreciate time more.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Random Polish Thought: Dziecko]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>As you know that I am learning Polish, I will probably post some random thoughts about this language over time.

Let's start with the first one.</p>

<p><strong>Inflected Part of Speech</strong></p>

<p>Some POS (Part of Speech) in Polish are inflected, means that their ending would change depending on subject, tenses, number, gender, or case. Those inflected POS are noun (<em>rzeczowniki</em>), adjective (<em>przymiotniki</em>), pronoun (<em>zaimki</em>), numeral (<em>liczebniki</em>), and verb (<em>czasowniki</em>). </p>

<p>Now, let's talk about adjective. Adjective is one of the inflected POS based on the gender of the subject or object that we describe. This is how the inflection works: <br>
<img src="http://www.akbargumbira.com/content/images/2015/10/adjective-1.png" alt="">
If it's masculine, then we need to inflect it to end with <em>y</em>. If the word ends with <em>k</em> or <em>g</em>, we inflect it to end with <em>i</em>. Simple enough.</p>

<p>Now, let's talk about dziecko (a child - which is neutral gender). When you describe a dziecko, you need to inflect the adjective with <em>-e</em>. So for example you want to say "My child is still small". In Polish it would be: "Moje dziecko jest jeszcze <em>ma≈Çe</em>"</p>

<p>Now the random thought is, what if that dziecko wants to describe him/herself? Would the child use neutral adjective? or just based on his/her gender? Let's imagine for a while if it's actually the first one (I hope it's the later). There must be a time when he/she is grown enough to not be called a dziecko anymore. Is there a Poles' celebration for that? Or maybe dziecko definition is 'a kid who can't speak, or write yet'? Hmm, I really need to tell my brain to shut up :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome GhostBuster!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I've been wanting to use Ghost and statically publish it on Github pages since ages ago.

Not sure why I didn't have time to do this before :)</p>

<p>So here it is, Ghost for the blogging platform, Buster for generating static pages, Github for hosting public static pages, BitBucket for hosting private Ghost sources, and the only thing I need is a domain. GhostBuster, They're here to save the world! :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
